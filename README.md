scrabble
========
Take the use of:
- checking the existence of words from particular letters, 
(You may choose if You want to look up the words in the whole database, in Yours or in others),
- adding and removing Your own words,
(It's possible to add words only from .txt files or those written in an input place)
- playing one of two games: guessing the word, finding the best word.
